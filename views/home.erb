<h3>Lets do it!</h3>
<p>    Is it possible? Can you really make a website in 5 minutes? Yes! It won't be pretty, but it will be able to be put online. We can make it pretty later, but first lets get online</p>

<p>
	     First thing's first. We need to download Ruby. Ruby is a programming language known for it's simple syntax and ease of learning. Ruby has many web frameworks (collections of code to make web apps easier) such as Rails. The reason I chose Sinatra is that it is an easier framework to learn and use, and it's a great introduction to MVC (Model View Controller) programing. 

	     To download Ruby go to <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Download Ruby</a>  

	     Great! Now that you have that installed lets begin:

	     </p>

	     <p>
	     1) Create the app
	     	Create a folder for all your Sinatra sites (To create a folder we use the command mkdir. This stands for Make DIRectory. All this does is create a folder)
	     	<div class="img-responsive">
	     	<img src="mkdir.png" class="img-responsive">
	     	</div>
	     	</p>

	     	<p>

	     	This sets up a folder for all your future sinatra projects

	     	<p>

	     2) Go into the folder using the cd command (The cd command stands for Change Directory. This is the commang that you use to move through all the folders on your computer)
	        cd sinatra
	        </p>

	    <p>
	<div class="img-responsive">
	    <img src="cdsinatra.png">
	    </div>
	     3) Now we're in the folder where our application lives. Lets create our webpage now! Lets make a site called puppies using the mkdir command and then enter that folder with the cd command:
	     <div class="container-fluid">
	     	<img src="puppies.png">
	     </div>
		  </p>

		  <p>
		  	Great! Now lets add some Sinatra Gems!
		  	Sinatra is a Ruby framework and Ruby has these packages of code called gems. We can get the sinatra gem like this (if you have root permission to your computer you don't have to type in the command sudo):

		  	<div class="img-responsive">
	     	<img src="gem_install.png">
	     </div>


		  </p>

		  <p>
		  	Great! Now we're ready to start making actual content!
		  	go to the the command prompt and create a file called app,rb. The app.rb file is the spine of the app. The reason that it has the .rb at the end is so the computer knows that this is a Ruby language file. This file will hold our routes. In Ruby on Rails the routes are part of what's called Controllers. That's doesn't mean much now, but when you progress to Ruby on Rails it's going to help you. I'm using the Sublime text editor, so the command to create a new file is subl.

		  		<img src="app.png">
		  	</div> 
		  </p>
